# Einstein CV Template
## How to write your CV with this template
This template requires [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

If you are new to LaTeX and are willing to give it a try, you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) with a free plan and get your hands dirty. This CV template is available in [Overleaf public gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates?q=CV+einstein). I actually drew inspiration from several templates published there.

## Request
This template can be improved in terms of code quality, as I am far from a LaTeX expert, and of appearance, as I am not exactly an artist. If you feel like making your own fork with your own ideas, please be kind and share your version on Overleaf, as a way to thank the community back.

I hope this template will bring luck in your job search!
