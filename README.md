# Einstein CV Template
## How to write your CV with this template
This template requires [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). IF you don't know what this means, then you should probably not invest your time learning it now[^1].

## How to customize the CV to your taste
To start with, I recommend you chose a color set at your liking. It all happens in [cv_einstein.cls](cv_einstein.cls). Trying different hues, saturations and brightnesses should be pretty easy.

All icons come from Font Awesome for LaTeX, whose documentation is available at [doc/fontawesome.pdf](doc/fontawesome.pdf).


## Request
This template can be improved in many ways, from code quality to its visual design. If you make a fork with your own ideas, please be kind and share your version back on Overleaf, as a way to thank the community.

I hope this template will make your job search successful!

[^1]: Still, if you are new to LaTeX and want to give it a try, I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) with a free plan. This CV template is available in [Overleaf's public gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates?q=CV+einstein) among many other templates I drew inspiration from.
